## Hands-on introduction to NGS variant analysis (2016-session)

Adapted session for a one-day training

Full information about the NGS-Variant hands-on training can be found on our <a href="http://wiki.bits.vib.be" target="_blank">BITS WIKI</a> in the dedicated pages starting at <a href="http://wiki.bits.vib.be/index.php/Hands-on_introduction_to_NGS_variant_analysis-2016" target="_blank">Hands-on_introduction_to_NGS_variant_analysis-2016</a>

Installation packages for executables used to develop this training are documented in two text files or stored as archives on our file server [NGSVAR2016-installers](http://data.bits.vib.be/pub/trainingen/NGSVAR2016/installers/).
Please check for more recent versions at the time you install these resources.

The code posted here will be maintained and might be different from that used during the training.

* [scripts](scripts): code relative to the unix command-line manipulation of the reads (QC, mapping, post-processing, ...). Two files called *dot_bashrc.txt* and *dot_myfunctions.txt* should be renamed respectively *.bashrc* and *.myfunctions* and placed in the user home folder. These two files contain system information tuned for the BITS training laptops and that will need edits to match other computers.
* other pieces of code are presented in the Wiki pages and meant to be copied and pasted in the terminal rather than stored as scripts.
